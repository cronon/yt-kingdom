https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security 1h
  remove unsafe-inline
check out npm audit 2h
deal with the warning on startup 15m
use shell.openPath instead of npm://open package

tech debt:
  use git lfs or download ffmpeg binaries by a script from their website
  e2e test
  googleAuth todo comment "check if it'll work" - understand what is it and check
  split big UI component into smaller components
  and css
  split big useFiles code into smaller pieces x2

  read about logs and switch to el.log 1h
use a class for Time - doesn't hurt anything right now, but Martin Fowler insists on it
  + became necessary when calculating percents


##### done #####
feature: customize title
feature: quit the login tab x2

feature: logout button

add artist name to song video name - no the title is without artist
don't log the creds
success screen: add youtube studio link
menu improvements
use percent for convert

pass isDebug on UI
pass isDebug on UI - again mock data is used as defaukt x3

seems YT lowers sound quiality, maybe even signifacantly, is it possible to do something about it
test sound quality
  YT does lower it, but there is nothing to do about it -

todo: stretch short names of mp3s
auto scroll logs
"02. Night tales" textarea had a vertiacal scrollbar
cancel button during inprogress
loading cursor
a little less yellow links in the success modal

maybe make an actual request to YT before converting
what happen if remove permissions for the app in youtube
handle YT error without reload

does it go so slowly because I'm converting 320kbits? - no, it is just slower on win8

better icon for remove song

checkbox to create youtube playlist
checkbox to upload separate songs

remove .mp3 part from the playlist

filefilter: mp3, jpg, png - done with it quickly when it became annoying
TODO check shell escape
  both for security and for accepting filenames with brackets
  handled by node spawn accepting arguments as an array. It was also needed to escape characters in legit song names

publish on github to test it on win 8 and not run with an usb stick
test with special characters
set scrollbars for long playlists

A warning during concat
[mp4 @ 0000020759ba8f20] Non-monotonous DTS in output stream 0:1; previous: 45238338, current: 33638144; changing to 45238339. This may result in incorrect timestamps in the output file.
